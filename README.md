# monoidal-setoid-categories #

A formalization of monoidal e-categories and e-categories-with-families (e-CWFs) in Agda

## Purpose ##

This was an earlier experiment on what will eventually be used in the ouroboros project. It's incomplete but has some interesting stuff in it that might be useful to other people. In particular, it contains part of the formalization of ITT internal categories-with-families.
